# Smart-Dustbin-Andriod-Project
. Project Legacy
1. Current Status of the project
After performing testing phase, we found lots of bugs in application. We fixed all the bugs after the testing phase using “pcloudy” site. Application performs well, the errors in authenticating have been resolved..
We are currently focusing on making the app more user-friendly, and on improving the android application interface attractive, since we have more people inside the campus so we are trying to make more dustbins.

2 Remaining Areas of concern
•	High usage of battery by the hardware equipments used in dustbin.
•	Database Management(AWS)
•	Only for Android Users
•	Not identify that either user throwing garbage or some heavy object.
•	Difficult to find a nearby dustbin.

3 Technical and Managerial lessons learnt
As after the completion of the project, we come to know many technical and managerial points. These points really help in the making of projects in future i.e, either  IOT or APP based.
•         learn how to make a circuit for the IoT based dustbin.
•      A better understanding of Java and  XML Language along with the coding of Arduino(i.e, in C language).
•            In the testing phase, we tested our application product using “pcloudy” site. And correcting mistakes after the testing.
  •           We learn how to send data to the database and fetch the credentials from the database and understand the importance of the DATABASE Support (AWS).
•            We learned how to work in a team. How to make different modules and then integrate them into one.
•            Last but not least for the maintenance of Product and how to make it durable for the future?
